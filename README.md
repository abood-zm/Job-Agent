# Job-Matching AI Agent

This project is a personal AI agent built with **LangChain** that automatically fetches job descriptions relevant to my experience, summarizes them, and sends notifications with the application links. It demonstrates practical usage of LLMs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and tool-based AI agents in a production-like workflow.

## Features

- **Automated Job Search**: Fetches job postings from multiple sources using modular search tools.
- **Experience Matching**: Compares job requirements to stored personal experience using a retrieval-based workflow.
- **Summarization**: Converts job descriptions and matches into concise, structured bullet points highlighting key responsibilities, required skills, and gaps.
- **Notifications**: Sends summarized job listings via email (or other notification channels) for easy access.
- **Extensible & Modular**: Each step (search, summarize, compare, notify) is implemented as a separate tool, making it easy to extend or modify.
- **Context-Aware Execution**: Uses `ToolRuntime` to securely provide personal context, such as experience, without exposing sensitive information to the LLM.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores personal information and previously processed jobs to avoid duplicates and track job application history.
- **Observability**: Middleware is used to monitor tool executions and debug the agent’s workflow.

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain** – for agent orchestration and tool integration  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – for comparing job descriptions to personal experience  
- **Vector Store / Memory** – for storing experience and job history  
- **Email / Notification Service** – for delivering job summaries  

## Project Goals

- Explore the construction of a **personalized AI agent** using LangChain.  
- Practice **RAG workflows**, retrieval, and context injection using `ToolRuntime`.  
- Demonstrate a **clean, modular architecture** suitable for production-level AI agents.  

## Future Improvements

- Add multiple job sources and more advanced relevance scoring  
- Incorporate multi-step reasoning for automated application suggestions  
- Support multiple notification channels (Slack, SMS, etc.)  
- Introduce analytics on job matches and skills gaps

This project is a showcase of **personalized AI agents in action**, highlighting how modern LLM frameworks like LangChain can integrate with external data, memory, and user context to provide actionable insights.
